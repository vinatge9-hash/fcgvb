# Niyantri Law - Website Build

This project provides a complete, production-ready law firm website built with Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and semantic HTML5 structure. It covers the required pages and demonstrates a clean, professional design consistent with a law firm.

Pages included:
- index.html (Home)
- about.html
- appointment.html
- law-rules.html
- recent-updates.html
- contact.html

Notes:
- All pages use Tailwind utility classes exclusively for styling (no external CSS files).
- Hero sections include a background image via inline style as specified in the design system.
- Internal navigation links are consistent across pages.
- Placeholder image content is implemented with https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1757325331955-9ba8182dc44e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1ODcxOTUyNXww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 tokens for easy replacement.
- Font placeholders (font-[primary-font], font-[secondary-font]) indicate category-appropriate typography to be processed by your pipeline.

Usage:
- Open any HTML file in a browser to view the page.
- Update content by editing the HTML files directly or via your generator workflow.
